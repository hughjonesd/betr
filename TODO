TODO


* ability for experimenter to move people on...
* tests for manual start
* way to pass messages back to user. (DONE: check() throws an
  error which is passed to the user via an error_message variable
  defined for main())
* how to allow some users to skip? (like Participate=0)

* how handle the idea that stages might have different states for 
  different groups? Could just be "provide a parameter called group" -
  all we need is a link to the people you are waiting for
* how to specify who to wait for at start and end of a stage?
* use addTaskCallback and friends to print something out at end of repl loops?

* minimize statefulness, record requests sent to handle_request
  Then set up replay()
  And autocreate fake participants using request records
* More generally, framework for faking participants

* RookServer should include ability to serve static files (perhaps via separate App?)

* Environment for stage functions
* Does pass_request pass a participant? Or just a client ID?
* How to easily identify computers in lab (if not by IP address)?
  - create a useful identify_computers() function 
  - serves a simple web app
  - which makes a list of IP address-> computer number
  - and/or sets a cookie on the client browsers and makes a list of cookie -> computer #

LATER
* Mturk et al payment integration?
* Command line interface and tools
* Documentation
* JSON server + HTML page
