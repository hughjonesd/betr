Writing experiments with betr
=============================

Rationale
---------


betr is an R package to design, test and run social scientific experiments. It 
uses the web to serve experiments, but it is suitable either for web- or 
lab-based experiments. It is designed to make writing, testing, debugging and 
running experiments as easy as possible.

## Why use betr?

Typically, social science experiments are run using computer software. The most
widely used software by economists is [zTree](www.iew.uzh.ch/ztree/). Others 
are written in Java, Python, or PHP. So, why use betr? 

The most important advantageis:

* betr is written in R, so you don't need to learn a new programming language
to use it.

That is true if you know R already. If you don't know R, but are an early-career
social scientist, then you probably need to learn at least one statistical 
software package. If you learn R, then you will also be able to use it to run
experiments in betr.

Some other advantages are:

* Experiments can be written in a full-featured programming languages.

While zTree's language lacks constructs such as functions, with betr you can use
all the features of R. _No more copy-pasting the same code across different periods._
R built-ins are also useful for writing experiments. Here's a standard way
to randomize over your subjects in zTree:

```
subjects.do{
  randomizer = random();
}
subjects.do{
  rand_id = count ( randomizer >= : randomizer );
}
```

The same thing in R is just:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rand_id <- sample(1:N)
```

* betr uses HTML to display experiments to subjects.

HTML is a powerful and flexible display language, so your experiments can be as
beautiful or as simple as you like.

* Debugging and testing is easy.

Testing experiments by hand can be a pain. Typically, you have to open one window for
each of your subjects, then type in responses manually. betr lessens that pain
by allowing automatic replay of sessions. So, you can test manually once, then
rerun the test automatically. 

* You can run experiments on the web or in the lab.

Obviously, since betr uses HTML, you can serve web-based experiments. In your
lab, you only need a web browser on client machines.
