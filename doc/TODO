BUGS
* RookServer not respecting port
* Needs this_url()
* Last period info of guessing-game is lost
* Autostart not working

TODO

* ability for experimenter to move people on...

* how to allow for different possible Ns, and general framework for when to start

* elegant, easy-to-use assignment to subjects
  - do we merge expt$subjects and experiment's actual data?
  - probably if it is easy...
  - subjects(id) and subjects(id)<- methods?
* in general what if we pass lots of stuff in to user-defined functions
  which just take (...)?

* easy interface to brew

* use addTaskCallback and friends to print something out at end of repl loops?

* replay()
* autocreate fake participants using request records
* More generally, framework for faking participants

* RookServer to serve static files (perhaps via separate App?)

* How to easily identify computers in lab (if not by IP address)?
  - create a useful identify_computers() function 
  - serves a simple web app
  - which makes a list of IP address-> computer number
  - and/or sets a cookie on the client browsers and makes a list of cookie -> computer #

* How to have different clients in the same windows of the webbrowser?
  - in development mode, set client_id as a param of the URL 
  - or even like /experiment/client_id ?

* More sophisticated stages.
  - stages with a run and check phase (and maybe setup and teardown)
LATER
* Mturk et al payment integration?
* Command line interface and tools
* Documentation
* JSON server + HTML page
